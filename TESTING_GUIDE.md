## Method 1: Quick Test (No Emails)
1. Click "Test CRON" button in dashboard
2. See what CRON would do right now

## Method 2: Create Test Blocks for Email Testing

### Step 1: Create a Block Starting in 10 Minutes
1. Go to dashboard
2. Click "Create New Block"
3. Fill in:
   - Title: "Test Study Block"
   - Start Time: [Current time + 10 minutes]

4. Click "Create Block"

### Step 2: Wait and Test

- Check your email for the reminder!

## Method 3: Manual CRON Trigger via API

curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/cron \
  -H "x-cron-key: your_cron_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "blocksFound": 1,
  "notificationsSent": 1,
  "errors": 0,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Method 4: Test Email System First

Please prepare your study space and get ready for a productive quiet study session! üìö

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Blocks found: 0"
- Check if block start time is exactly 10 minutes from now
- Verify block wasn't already processed (notification_sent = true)
- Look at MongoDB to see actual block data

### Issue: "Notifications sent: 0" but blocks found
- Check email configuration (SENDGRID_API_KEY, EMAIL_FROM)
- Test email system separately first
- Check console logs for email errors

### Issue: "CRON test failed: Unauthorized"
- Add CRON_SECRET_KEY to .env.local
- Restart development server
- Try again

## MongoDB Queries for Debugging

```javascript
// Check blocks in MongoDB
db.blocks.find({}).sort({start_time: 1})

// Check notification status
db.blocks.find({notification_sent: true})

// Find blocks starting soon
db.blocks.find({
  start_time: {
    $gte: new Date(),
    $lt: new Date(Date.now() + 15 * 60 * 1000) // Next 15 minutes
  }
})
```
